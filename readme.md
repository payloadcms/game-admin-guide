# Payload CMS Game Admin Guide

This repository was created as a companion to the blog post at https://payloadcms.com/blog/headless-cms-game-development

The general features are:
- Manage player accounts
- Record games with teams, players and scores
- Manage and automatically award achievements based on player stats
- Handle in-app purchases
- Image uploads for achievements and purchasable items
- Access Controls for security

Though quite thorough for a blog post, this work should be considered incomplete and ready to be built upon for your own needs.
